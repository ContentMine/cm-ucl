A repository to openly track progress on table extraction.

## Background
the [EPPICentre at UCL, London](http://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/) has sponsored a collaboration with [The Content Mine](www.contentmine.org) to automatically extract tables from PDFs in the scientific/scholarly literature. 

## Goals
The primary goal is to provide semantic material of high *measurable* quality for use in systematic reviews. The project involves technology development by ContentMine and measurement (metrics) of success by both parties.

## Open
All software is Open, compliant with the [OSI license definitions](https://opensource.org/licenses). Software from TheContentMine ("AMI", and other packages ("getpapers", "quickscrape") is generally licenced Apache2 (see this project). Other software will normally be under similar Open Licences - where GPL is used it will be distinct modules that are linked by data files, not program APIs.

The intention is that Data conforms to the [Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org). Since most of the raw data is copyrighted scholarly publications we try to ensure this by using only compliant sources ("CC BY"). However as copyright is the among the most complex and impenetrable and uncertain legislation produced in the Galaxy certainty cannot be guaranteed. 

The intention is, therefore, that all “Open data and content can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose” (Open Definition), BUT we require attribution. If you re-use a program in your software you must acknowledge it. 

## Tidy Data
Hadley Wickham has produced a stunningly simple. clear and revolutionary approach to the semantics of tabular data ["Tidy Data"](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf). We believe that most of the truly tabular data can be recast to this form and it is a goal of this project to provide the technology within the Open AMI system.


## Open notebook
We intend that this project will be run as [Open Notebook Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science) where all code, data, experiments are open and can be independently validated from the public face of the project. As Jean-Claude Bradley [writes](http://drexel-coas-elearning.blogspot.co.uk/2006/09/open-notebook-science.html):
<blockquote>
... there is a URL to a laboratory notebook that is freely available and indexed on common search engines. It does not necessarily have to look like a paper notebook but it is essential that all of the information available to the researchers to make their conclusions is equally available to the rest of the world
</blockquote>

## copyright issues and choice of material
Because the raw data is the scientific/scholarly literature most of it is copyrighted and the ownership transferred to "publishers". Many of these constructively wish their material to be re-used in new ways, but some oppose this type of mining activity and have threatened legal action or have cut off subscribers. We cannot then take a random selection of material (as we would like) because negotiating rights with publishers is slow, expensive, messy and drains energy. We have therefore selected "open" material and believe that the selection is legally sound. However we note that the scholarly publishing world has very little legal clarity and if we are required to remove material that the publisher claims is "their copyright" we will do so. This may affect the statistics and metrics of the final results. We therefore have to give it wide publicity to ensure that the project is Open.
