<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><span class="head">Introduction </span><p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common mental disorders, with an estimated lifetime prevalence in the USA of 19.2 % (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="1,375.13,545.11,70.02,9.07" target="#b20">Kessler et al. 2010</span> ). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are efficacious in treating MDD and are the most commonly prescribed first-line therapy. However, their clinical effectiveness is often limited by poor adherence and discontinuation due to lack of therapeutic response and adverse effects (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="1,420.13,607.35,65.62,9.07" target="#b29">Nantz et al. 2009</span> ). Sexual dysfunction , which affects up to 60 % of patients treated with SSRIs (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="1,337.83,632.24,97.64,9.07" target="#b19">Kennedy and Rizvi 2009)</span> , is a leading cause of treatment nonadherence (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="1,391.00,644.71,71.97,9.07" target="#b2">Ashton et al. 2005</span>) and is reported by patients to be one of the most unacceptable side effects associated with SSRIs (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="1,386.03,669.60,53.50,9.07" target="#b16">Hu et al. 2004</span>). Therefore, reducing the incidence and burden of sexual dysfunction associated with SSRIs is important in improving clinical outcomes in patients with MDD. Approaches to mitigating the sexual dysfunction associated with SSRI treatment include lowering dosage, switching antidepressant medications, or adding concomitant medications such as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor type 5 (PDE5; e.g., sildenafil), a norepinephrinedopamine reuptake inhibitor (e.g., bupropion), or a 5- HT 1A receptor partial agonist (e.g., buspirone) (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="2,267.31,134.14,21.84,9.07;2,51.02,146.55,80.24,9.07" target="#b35">Rizvi and Kennedy 2013</span>). Clinical and preclinical evidence supports a role for the 5-HT 1A receptor in regulating sexual behavior. Buspirone was shown to improve sexual function in depressed patients that were experiencing sexual dysfunction while taking the SSRIs paroxetine and citalopram (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="2,103.06,208.86,75.79,9.07" target="#b23">Landen et al. 1999</span>). In male rats, buspirone and full 5-HT 1A receptor agonists (8-OH-DPAT and flesinoxan) promoted sexual behavior by decreasing ejaculation latencies (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="2,126.76,246.22,71.06,9.07" target="#b6">Chan et al. 2010;</span><span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="2,201.61,246.22,78.80,9.07" target="#b38"> Snoeren et al. 2014</span>). In contrast, the 5-HT 1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 inhibited sexual behavior when it was coadministered with citalopram (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="2,129.48,283.58,91.19,9.07" target="#b13">de Jong et al. 2005a</span>) or paroxetine (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="2,55.97,296.00,80.27,9.07" target="#b25">Looney et al. 2005</span>) and when administered in 5-HT T knockout rats (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="2,117.15,308.47,67.41,9.07" target="#b7">Chan et al. 2011</span>). These studies suggest that 5-HT 1A receptor antagonism only inhibits sexual behaviors under conditions of chronically elevated serotonin (5-HT) (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="2,86.96,345.83,72.75,9.07" target="#b31">Olivier et al. 2011</span>). Vilazodone is an SSRI and 5-HT 1A receptor partial agonist (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="2,92.16,370.72,113.85,9.07" target="#b12">Dawson and Watson 2009</span>) approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of MDD in adults (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="2,133.88,395.61,45.40,9.07">Forest 2011</span>). Efficacy for vilazodone in adults with MDD was demonstrated in two pivotal trials (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="2,82.65,420.55,78.04,9.07" target="#b21">Khan et al. 2011;</span><span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="2,166.16,420.55,83.45,9.07" target="#b34"> Rickels et al. 2009</span>); safety was further supported in a 52-week open-label study ( ). Vilazodone treatment was associated with relatively low adverse impact on sexual function relative to the high prevalence of sexual dysfunction in patients at baseline (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="2,158.81,482.80,83.28,9.07" target="#b9">Clayton et al. 2013</span>). Limited evidence from these clinical trials in MDD has shown that the incidence of sexual dysfunction was similar between patients treated with vilazodone and patients treated with placebo, suggesting that vilazodone may be associated with less sexual dysfunction than other SSRIs (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="2,55.44,557.52,77.56,9.07" target="#b9">Clayton et al. 2013</span>). The mechanism by which 5-HT 1A receptor agonists affect sexual behavior is not well understood. Previous evidence showing that 5-HT 1A receptor agonists can stimulate male sexual function (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="2,193.58,607.35,95.52,9.07" target="#b5">Blier and Ward 2003;</span><span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="2,51.02,619.77,79.16,9.07" target="#b6"> Chan et al. 2010;</span><span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="2,135.93,619.77,86.89,9.07" target="#b38"> Snoeren et al. 2014</span>) suggests that the clinical advantages of vilazodone may in part be mediated through its activity at the 5-HT 1A receptor. This study compared the effects of vilazodone treatment and other SSRIs on copulatory and ejaculatory behaviors , as well as on brain 5-HT receptor and transporter levels in select forebrain regions of the limbic system in male rats. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><span class="head">Materials and methods Animals </span><p>Male and female Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories, Germany), initially weighing 250-300 g, were group housed (4 per cage) and maintained under reversed 12/12 h day/night cycles (lights off 7:00 a.m.; lights on 7:00 p.m.); food and water were available ad libitum. Estrus was induced in female rats by a single injection of 50 μg estradiol benzoate dissolved in sesame oil 36 to 42 h before testing with a male rat. Animals were weighed on days 1, 7, and 14 of the drug experiment. All behavioral experiments, including the drug administrations, were reviewed and approved by Utrecht University's animal welfare committee (DEC). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><span class="head">Drugs </span><p>Vilazodone hydrochloride (1, 3, 10 mg/kg) and citalopram hydrochloride (10, 30 mg/kg) were received from Forest Laboratories, LLC. Paroxetine (10 mg/kg) was obtained from a local pharmacy (20 mg tablet, Hexal Pharma Nederland BV) and crushed into powder form. All drugs were dissolved or suspended in vehicle (1 % methylcellulose and water) and were administered orally (PO) at a dose volume of 2 mL/kg. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><span class="head">Sexual behavior test </span><p> The sexual behavior test was performed as previously described (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="2,340.00,420.54,56.51,9.07" target="#b6">Chan et al. 2010</span>). Briefly, estrus was induced in female rats with estradiol injection 36 to 42 h before testing. Male rats were placed in an observation cage (30 × 40 × 60 cm) for a 30- min habituation period. Following the habituation period, an estrous female was placed in the cage and video recording commenced for 30 min. The frequencies of mounts (no vaginal penetration), intromissions (vaginal penetration), and ejaculations , and the latency to the first ejaculation (time between first mount to ejaculation) were measured and scored during the 30- min test using Observer® 5.0 (Noldus, Wageningen, The Netherlands). Copulatory efficiency was defined as [number of intromissions / (number of intromissions + number of mounts)] × 100 %. Data from the first ejaculation series, which included all events occurring before the first ejaculation, were reported for mounting frequency, ejaculation latency, and copulatory efficiency. The ejaculation frequency for the entire 30- min test was reported. All assessments were performed in the dark phase of the light/dark cycle under dim red light conditions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><span class="head">Sexual training and the selection of male rats </span><p>In order to achieve stable sexual behavior, male rats (N = 145) were trained once per week for five consecutive weeks (pretreatment) against an estrous female in an observation cage. Male rats that exhibited an ejaculation frequency of 2– 3 per 30-min test in the final two of the five training sessions were classified as normal-performers (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="3,203.05,96.78,64.15,9.07" target="#b33">Pattij et al. 2005</span>) and were included in the drug studies (n = 98). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><span class="head">Experimental design </span><p>Sexual behavior test Normal-performing male rats were randomly divided into seven treatment groups (n = 14/group): vehicle, vilazodone 1 mg/ kg, vilazodone 3 mg/kg, vilazodone 10 mg/kg, citalopram 10 mg/kg, citalopram 30 mg/kg, and paroxetine 10 mg/kg. All treatments were administered once daily for 14 days, either 1 h before the sexual test or around 11:00 a.m. on days without a sex test. The evaluations of sexual behaviors were performed on day 1 (acute), day 7 (subchronic), and day 14 (chronic). </p></div>

Rats were decapitated, and their brains were rapidly excised and stored at −80 °C. Next, coronal sections (10 μm) were cut on a cryostat at −20 °C and stored at −80 °C. Brain tissue from regions that are thought to mediate neural pathways and behaviors (and are typically disturbed in MDD patients) were selected for evaluation (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="3,76.64,457.90,66.11,9.07" target="#b3">Baldessarini 2006</span> ).

Post hoc comparisons showed that vilazodone-treated rats did not display any significant differences from vehicle-treated rats in sexual behavior after 7 days of treatment.

SSRI treatment has been associated with dysfunction of the three sequential aspects of the sexual response cycle: sexual desire (i.e., libido), arousal (i.e., erectile function in men), and orgasm (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="6,340.74,619.76,93.14,9.07" target="#b37">Serretti and Chiesa 2009</span>).

Since the 5-HT system maintains an inhibitory tone on sexual behavior, chronic elevation of extracellular 5-HT by SSRI treatment is believed to underlie delayed and inhibited ejaculation in men (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="7,384.84,520.16,64.92,9.07" target="#b36">Rosen et al. 1999</span>) and male rats (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="7,515.74,520.16,28.57,9.07;7,306.14,532.63,30.58,9.07" target="#b6">Chan et al. 2010</span>). Notably, the acute treatments had no effects on sexual behavior which, given the inhibitory role of 5-HT in sexual behaviors, may seem surprising. Acute administration of SSRIs and vilazodone results in rapid and sharp increases in extracellular 5-HT levels in the rat medial and lateral cortices (van <span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="7,325.65,594.88,117.09,9.07" target="#b40">Amsterdam and Seyfried 2014</span> ) and in the ventral hippocampus (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="7,343.61,607.35,60.74,9.07" target="#b32">Page et al. 2002</span> ). The increase in 5-HT levels following vilazodone treatment was nearly two times greater than following citalopram, paroxetine, or fluoxetine (van Amsterdam and Seyfried 2014). However, evidence in humans and rats suggests that acute treatments of SSRIs generally do not cause sexual dysfunction (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="7,468.35,669.60,75.89,9.07" target="#b31">Olivier et al. 2011;</span><span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="7,306.16,682.07,81.08,9.07" target="#b41"> Waldinger et al. 2001</span><span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="7,393.92,682.07,16.97,9.07" target="#b42"> Waldinger et al. , 2002</span> ); rather, SSRI-related sexual dysfunction is likely dependent upon delayed neurochemical adaptions following chronic, but not acute, elevation of  HT as well as modulations of neuroendocrine and other neurotransmitter systems (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,139.29,71.83,73.85,9.07" target="#b9">Clayton et al. 2013;</span><span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,215.04,71.83,65.86,9.07" target="#b31"> Olivier et al. 2011</span>). One notable exception may be the SSRI, dapoxetine, which has been developed for the treatment of premature ejaculation. The acute effects of dapoxetine on ejaculatory function have been attributed to its pharmacokinetic profile (i.e., rapid absorption and elimination) and its targeting of excitatory thalamic and hypothalamic regions associated with ejaculatory response (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,93.25,159.02,81.22,9.07" target="#b11">Clément et al. 2012;</span><span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,178.08,159.02,61.24,9.07" target="#b26"> McMahon 2011</span>).

From this standpoint, dapoxetine does not appear to differ from other SSRIs in its pharmacologic ability to inhibit ejaculation latency in either rats or men (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,221.03,246.22,47.70,9.07" target="#b30">Olivier 2015</span>). In contrast to vilazodone, acute administration of 5-HT 1A receptor agonists stimulates copulatory and ejaculatory behaviors in male rats (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,92.39,283.58,72.44,9.07" target="#b0">Arnone et al. 1995;</span><span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,166.83,283.58,79.42,9.07" target="#b14"> de Jong et al. 2005b;</span><span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,248.32,283.58,40.89,9.07;8,51.03,296.00,29.37,9.07" target="#b38"> Snoeren et al. 2014</span>), which may be due to the differences between full and partial agonism at the 5-HT 1A receptor; other differences in acute neurophysiological and behavioral responses in rats have been reported between full 5-HT 1A receptor agonists and vilazodone (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,100.45,345.83,84.56,9.07" target="#b4">Bartoszyk et al. 1997;</span><span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,187.57,345.83,59.95,9.07" target="#b32"> Page et al. 2002</span>). Since the impetus for this study was to better understand the adverse effects of SSRIs and other antidepressants on sexual functioning in patients who require such treatments, the current study focused on brain regions in the limbic system known to be associated with MDD and SSRI-mediated sexual dysfunction (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,110.39,420.55,80.69,9.07" target="#b3">Baldessarini 2006;</span><span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,195.64,420.55,84.30,9.07" target="#b38"> Snoeren et al. 2014</span>). However, it is important to note that other structures rich in 5-HT receptors, such as the raphé magnus, raphé pallidus, and gigantocelluar nuclei of the ventral medulla, may also contribute to the effects of antidepressants on male sexual behavior. Studies in rats have reported various effects of SSRIs on 5-HT receptor density. For example, repeated citalopram exposure was found to increase 5-HT 1A receptors and decrease 5-HT 2A receptors in the hippocampus in one study (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,236.28,520.16,52.85,9.07;8,51.02,532.63,16.84,9.07" target="#b22">Klimek et al. 1994</span>), while a later study using positron emission tomography along with autoradiographic assays found no effect of chronic citalopram on 5-HT 1A receptor density in the dorsal raphé nucleus, frontal cortex, or hippocampus (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,214.62,569.99,74.56,9.07;8,51.02,582.41,28.34,9.07" target="#b28">Moulin-Sallanon et al. 2009</span>). Repeated administration with paroxetine in rats was shown to have no effect on the density of 5-HT 1A receptors in the hypothalamus (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,125.19,607.35,46.82,9.07" target="#b24">Li et al. 1997</span>). In the current study, chronic vilazodone treatment reduced postsynaptic 5-HT 1A receptor levels in the cortical and hippocampal regions, while citalopram and paroxetine increased 5-HT 1A receptor levels in the same brain regions. Importantly, the differential effects of the drugs on postsynaptic 5-HT 1A receptor levels occurred in the limbic cortex (MPC and EC) and the hippocampus. These are key brain substrates that receive afferent 5-HT projections from the dorsal and median raphé nucleus and are involved in the regulation of ejaculation (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,486.63,59.41,57.65,9.07;8,306.15,71.83,17.72,9.07" target="#b38">Snoeren et al. 2014</span>). Stimulation of postsynaptic 5-HT 1A receptors by vilazodone via both direct activation and elevated extracellular 5-HT levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,310.85,109.19,77.18,9.07" target="#b17">Hughes et al. 2005;</span><span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,391.53,109.19,63.79,9.07" target="#b32"> Page et al. 2002</span>) may lead to 5-HT 1A receptor downregulation. The results of 5-HT 1A receptor downregulation and lack of sexual side effects with vilazodone may complement a recent electrophysiology study by Ashby et al. This study reported that presynaptic 5-HT 1A autoreceptors in the dorsal raphé nuclei , which normally inhibit 5-HT neuron firing, showed much greater desensitization following chronic vilazodone treatment than following a similar treatment with fluoxetine (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,510.30,208.86,34.01,9.07;8,306.14,221.27,28.25,9.07" target="#b1">Ashby et al. 2013</span>). Therefore, this desensitization would be expected to increase extracellular 5-HT release in afferent brain regions, including the cortex and hippocampus, and consequently result in a higher likelihood of sexual side effects following chronic vilazodone administration compared with conventional SSRIs. However, one possible explanation for the lack of sexual side effects of vilazodone is that the 5-HT 1A partial agonist activity of this molecule may stimulate the postsynaptic 5-HT 1A receptors which can counteract the inhibitory effects of elevated extracellular 5-HT resulting from presynaptic 5-HT 1A receptor desensitization and 5-HT T blockade. In accordance with this explanation, systemic administration of several other 5-HT 1A receptor agonists and partial agonists enhanced ejaculatory behaviors in male rodents (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,505.70,383.19,38.55,9.07;8,306.14,395.60,34.73,9.07" target="#b0">Arnone et al. 1995;</span><span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,344.09,395.60,83.74,9.07" target="#b14"> de Jong et al. 2005b;</span><span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,431.04,395.60,74.36,9.07" target="#b38"> Snoeren et al. 2014</span> ). For instance , de <span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,345.49,408.08,70.95,9.07" target="#b14">Jong et al. (2005b) </span>reported that a challenge with the full 5-HT 1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT in male rats chronically treated with paroxetine restored the sexual behavior of these animals. Vilazodone has demonstrated comparable activity to 8-OH-DPAT at postsynaptic 5-HT 1A receptors in hippocampal tissue (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,378.71,470.32,73.17,9.07" target="#b17">Hughes et al. 2005</span>). If this hypothesis is correct, the timing of the sexual behavior tests in rats relative to drug administration may be critical and will be investigated in a future study. In humans, however, this may be less of an issue because of the much longer half-life of vilazodone. Chronic treatment with vilazodone, citalopram, and paroxetine reduced 5-HT T levels in all of the tested forebrain regions . This is consistent with existing literature demonstrating that elevated extracellular 5-HT concentrations in vitro (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,310.34,582.41,81.25,9.07" target="#b18">Jorgensen et al. 2014</span> ) and chronic SSRI and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) treatment in vivo (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,310.53,607.35,65.08,9.07" target="#b27">Mirza et al. 2007</span>) can lead to reduced 5-HT T expression. A consequence of reduced 5-HT T availability is enhanced postsynaptic serotonergic neurotransmission, which may in turn contribute to sexual dysfunction (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="8,444.60,644.72,63.67,9.07" target="#b7">Chan et al. 2011</span>). In the current study, the magnitude of reductions in 5-HT T levels was greater for citalopram and paroxetine (maximum reductions of 80 and 91 %, respectively) than for vilazodone (maximum reduction of 58 %). Because of the differential effects of vilazodone relative to the SSRIs on both 5-HT T and 5-HT 1A receptors, it is likely that the dynamics of extracellular 5-HT differ between rats that are chronically treated with the two different types of antidepressants. The increases in cortical 5-HT 2A receptor levels following the different types of antidepressant treatments may suggest a common mechanism of action that mediates the beneficial therapeutic effects of dissimilar antidepressant drugs. The 5-HT 2A receptor is purported to have an inhibitory role in copulatory behavior, as shown by a decreased number of rats that initiated copulation after receiving 5-HT 2A receptor agonists in a sexual behavior test (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="9,108.04,183.91,68.79,9.07" target="#b31">Olivier et al. 2011</span>). During the day 14 sexual behavior tests, the majority of citalopram-and paroxetinetreated rats had ≤2 ejaculations and several rats had no ejaculations . These results may be related to elevated 5-HT 2A receptor activity following increased expression in cortical areas. </p></div>

In the current preclinical studies, unlike the conventional SSRIs, vilazodone was not associated with diminished copulatory or ejaculatory behaviors in male rats. These results support clinical trial data showing that vilazodone treatment, while effective in improving depressive symptoms, was associated with a relatively low incidence of direct adverse effects on sexual function (<span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="9,132.24,447.31,73.72,9.07" target="#b9">Clayton et al. 2013</span><span class="ref"  type="bibr" coords="9,213.72,447.31,16.83,9.07" target="#b10">Clayton et al. , 2015</span>).

Following incubation, sections were washed twice for 5 min in ice-cold buffer, rinsed in water, and air dried. 5-HT 2A receptor levels were determined as previously described (Tarazi et al. 2002). Sections were preincubated for 1 h at RT in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7). Next, sections were incubated for 1 h at RT in fresh buffer containing 3.0 nM [ 3 H]ketanserin, 1 μM prazosin, and 100 nM tetrabenzine with the NSB 1 μM methysergide. Following the incubation, sections were washed twice for 30 min in ice-cold buffer, rinsed in water, and air-dried. For image analysis, radiolabeled slides and calibrated [ 3 H]standards (Amersham) were exposed to Biomax MR films for 5–6 weeks at 4 °C. The films were developed and fixed in Kodak D-19 for 5 min at RT. Optical density (OD) in brain regions of interest was measured with a computerized densitometric image analyzer (MCID-4 system, Imaging Research; St. Catharines, Ontario). OD was converted to nCi/mg of tissue with calibrated [ 3 H]standards. After subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding, the specific binding was determined and expressed as femtomole bound per milligram tissue. Statistical analysis All behavioral data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA; SPSSv22.0) to test for overall significance. If overall significant effects were found, post hoc Dunnett t tests were used to evaluate differences between active-and vehicletreatment groups on the same experimental day. Data from the autoradiography assays were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA to evaluate changes across treatments and brain regions for each assay. In case of overall statistically significant effects for drug or brain region, post hoc Dunnett t tests were used to evaluate differences between treatment and vehicle groups. All significance testing was two-sided at the P &lt; .05 level. All values are shown as the mean and standard error of the mean (SEM).
