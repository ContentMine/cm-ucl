Your estimated risk of hip fracture in the next 5 years is: 5%. This means that in a group of 100 people of the same age and gender as you, who had similar risk factors for fracture as you, 20 would have an osteoporotic fracture within the next 5 years, and 5 would have a hip fracture within the next 5 years. Osteoporosis medication reduces osteoporotic fractures by 33%, and hip fractures by 40%. This means that if all these 100 people took osteoporosis medication for 5 years, the number of people who would have an osteoporotic fracture within those 5 years would decrease from 20 to 13. The number who would have a hip fracture within those 5 years would decrease from 5 to 3. This means that in a group of 100 people of the same age and gender as you, who had similar risk factors for fracture as you, 80 will not have an osteoporotic fracture within the next 5 years, and 95 will not have a hip fracture within the next 5 years. Osteoporosis medication reduces osteoporotic fractures by 33%, and hip fractures by 40%. This means that if all these 100 people took osteoporosis treatments for 5 years, the number of people who would not have an osteoporotic fracture within those 5 years would increase from 80 to 87. The number of people who would not have a hip fracture within those 5 years would increase from 95 to 97. This means that in a group of 100 people of the same age and gender as you, who had similar risk factors for fracture as you, 20 would have an osteoporotic fracture within the next 5 years, and 5 would have a hip fracture within the next 5 years. Osteoporosis medication reduces osteoporotic fractures by 33%, and hip fractures by 40%. This means that 15 people like you would need to be treated with osteoporosis medications for 5 years to prevent 1 osteoporotic fracture. 50 people like you would need to be treated for 5 years to prevent 1 hip fracture. This means that in a group of 100 people of the same age and gender as you, who had similar risk factors for fracture as you, 80 will not have an osteoporotic fracture within the next 5 years, and 95 will not have a hip fracture within the next 5 years. Osteoporosis medication reduces osteoporotic fractures by 33%, and hip fractures by 40%. This means that if 15 people like you were treated with osteoporosis medications for 5 years, 14 would receive no benefit in terms of osteoporotic fracture prevention, and in 1 person a fracture would be prevented. If 50 people like you were treated for 5 years, 49 would receive no benefit in terms of hip fracture prevention, and in 1 person a hip fracture would be prevented. "
"For illustrative purposes, all options use a 5-year 20% risk of osteoporotic fracture and 5% risk of hip fracture."
